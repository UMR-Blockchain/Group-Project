## Group-Project

The idea is to build a generic E-Commerce website for healthcare products and daily essentials and use blockchain technology for maintaining the Transaction Ledger and for Supply Chain Management. 

-Blockchain acts as an immutable store of data and removes the need for one or more third parties. It
can help save both businesses’ and consumers’ time and money in this case. Using this, we’ll be storing the details of the transactions on a blockchain so that they cannot be tampered with, and the overall process becomes more secure. 

-Also, the product details will be stored on a blockchain, along with their current location in the supply chain, once a product is purchased. 

-A QR code will be generated which the customer can scan once the product arrives, making sure that what they receive is what they paid money for.The idea is to build a generic E-Commerce website for healthcare products and daily essentials and use blockchain technology for maintaining the Transaction Ledger and for Supply Chain Management.
